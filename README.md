Submitted by: **Todd Maracle**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* Uses a slide bar to split bill for up to 10 people
* Has a settings screen where one can turn on / off rounding the tip amount
* Changed the design and layout with different fonts, colors and background colors
* Made an icon for the app

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

This was my first experience using Xcode and working with Swift, so was challenging. However, the code so far was not too difficult to pick up and the instructions 
were easy to follow.
I had to search for answers on how to do some of the optional and additional features. I struggled with a couple things, such as getting the settings screen to 
remember the setting when you go back to it, so I had to figure out a way to accomplish being able to use it purposefully without doing so. But this is something I 
will have to learn for future projects. I also spent a good amount of time going back into the code to find what was incorrect to get it working, naturally. All in 
all, this was a great project, fun, and I'm looking forward to the next.
